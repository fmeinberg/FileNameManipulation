To make the package available to Mathematica, move the .m file to a location on your $Path. Default values are:

ToFileName[$UserBaseDirectory,"Applications"]

ToFileName[$BaseDirectory,"Applications"]

You load a Mathematica package that is located within a directory in your $Path by running

<<PackageName`

or

Needs["PackageName`"]

Enjoy!
